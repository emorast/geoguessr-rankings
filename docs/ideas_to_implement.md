# Ideas to implement

## Description
Document containing ideas and functionality which will be developed and hopefully implemented when the required functionality to support them is in place. The ideas are categorized as `visuals`, `functionality`and `data-processing`.

Every idea should have the main prerequisites for that idea listed.

## Visuals
- Graph each week showing how the league that week unfolded.

## Functionality

## Data-processing
- Create a table with every players elo-ranking over time. That way every players progress can be tracked
